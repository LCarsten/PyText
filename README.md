# PyText
# Module reads specific content from existing html pages for Videotext
# Purpose is mainly to receive valid information about the local weather forecast
# Unfortunately this information needs to be taken from an videotext site.
# Afterwards, the information will be used to feed a raspi zero with an old style LED matrix board
